# Suface-reconstruction-form-point-clouds-for-crop-canopies
The surface reconstruction is a Crust-based method which firstly adopts the Crust method to triangulation and then uses a statistic method to filter abnormal facets (i.e. triangles).The output plant model can be used to directly calculate the leaf area and link to ray-tracing models for canopy photosynthesis calculation.

# Software information
This software is based on MATLAB R2020b.Before you use the software, you should verify that version 9.9 (R2020b) of the MATLAB Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2020b 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

Inputï¼šinput file path, point clouds name, output file path, output plant model name, threshold of mesh outlier (default 3), threshold of surface smoothing (default 0.5)

Output: meshed_plant_model 


Note: 
1) The input point cloud is must from the PLY or PCD file
2) The output point cloud is the PLY file


# Example
Using the software in the windows DOS command line:

E:\PCSR\PCSR.exe "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pc.ply" "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pm.ply"
E:\PCSR\PCSR.exe "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pc.ply" "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pm.ply" 3 0.5 1

Using the software in the MATLAB:

cmd=['E:\PCSR\PCSR.exe "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pc.ply" "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pm.ply"']; 
system(cmd)

cmd=['E:\PCSR\PCSR.exe "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pc.ply" "E:\PCSR" "example_maize_pm.ply" 3 0.5 1'];
system(cmd)
